## Prerequisites
- Hugging Face account with model repository access
- HF_TOKEN environment variable set
- Python packages: `huggingface_hub`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation data in structured format (CSV, JSON)

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Evaluation Results
Format your evaluation data:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create evaluation results dataframe
eval_results = pd.DataFrame({
    "model_name": ["CropYieldNet_v1", "CropYieldNet_v2"],
    "mae": [0.15, 0.12],
    "rmse": [0.22, 0.18],
    "r2_score": [0.87, 0.91],
    "dataset": "US_Corn_Yields_2020-2023",
    "test_samples": 1000
})
```

### Step 2: Generate Evaluation Report
Create comprehensive evaluation summary:
```python
def generate_eval_report(eval_results, model_name):
    report = f"""
# Model Evaluation Report: {model_name}

## Performance Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error**: {eval_results['mae']:.3f}
- **Root Mean Square Error**: {eval_results['rmse']:.3f}
- **R² Score**: {eval_results['r2_score']:.3f}

## Dataset Information
- **Test Dataset**: {eval_results['dataset']}
- **Sample Size**: {eval_results['test_samples']:,}
- **Evaluation Date**: {pd.Timestamp.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

## Agricultural Context
This model was evaluated on historical crop yield data spanning multiple
growing seasons and geographic regions. Performance metrics reflect
real-world prediction accuracy for yield forecasting applications.
"""
    return report
```

### Step 3: Update Model Card
Add evaluation results to model card:
```python
from huggingface_hub import update_repo_metadata

# Prepare model card content
model_card_content = f"""

# {model_name}

## Model Description
{model_description}

## Evaluation Results
{evaluation_report}

## Usage
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("your-username/{model_name}")
```
"""

# Update model card
update_repo_metadata(
    repo_id="your-username/your-model",
    token=your_hf_token,
    metadata=model_card_content
)
```

### Step 4: Track Performance Over Time
Maintain evaluation history:
```python
def track_model_performance(model_id, new_results):
    # Load existing evaluation history
    history_file = f"eval_history_{model_id.replace('/', '_')}.json"
    
    try:
        with open(history_file, 'r') as f:
            history = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        history = []
    
    # Add new evaluation results
    new_entry = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "results": new_results,
        "version": get_current_model_version(model_id)
    }
    history.append(new_entry)
    
    # Save updated history
    with open(history_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(history, f, indent=2)
```

## Agricultural Evaluation Best Practices

- Account for seasonal variations and climate patterns
- Test on different geographic regions and soil types
- Consider weather variability and extreme events

### Real-World Testing

- Include economic impact assessments
- Test on diverse farming operations and scales
- Consider practical deployment constraints

### Benchmark Comparisons

yield_model = "CropYieldNet_v2"
test_data = load_yield_test_data("2023_season_data.csv")

# Run evaluation
predictions = yield_model.predict(test_data)
metrics = calculate_regression_metrics(test_data["actual_yield"], predictions)

# Generate and save report
eval_report = generate_eval_report(metrics, yield_model)
update_model_card("your-org/crop-yield-predictor", eval_report)
```

### 2. Disease Detection Model Comparison
```python
# Compare multiple disease detection models
models = ["PlantDiseaseNet_v1", "PlantDiseaseNet_v2", "ResNet50-PlantDisease"]
test_images = load_disease_test_set("plant_disease_test/")

results = []
for model in models:
    predictions = model.predict(test_images)
    metrics = calculate_classification_metrics(test_images["labels"], predictions)
    results.append({"model": model, **metrics})

# Create comparison report
comparison_report = create_comparison_table(results)
update_model_card("your-org/plant-detection-suite", comparison_report)
```

### 3. Model Performance Tracking
```python
# Track model performance over time
model_id = "your-org/weather-forecaster"
new_eval_results = evaluate_weather_model(model_id, "2024_data")

# Add to performance history
track_model_performance(model_id, new_eval_results)

# Generate performance trend analysis
trend_analysis = analyze_performance_trends(model_id)
update_model_card(model_id, trend_analysis)
```
