# Satellite OSINT & Land Analysis

Open satellite maps via deeplinks. Capture at multiple zoom levels. Analyze land/structures.

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Address-First Approach (FASTEST METHOD)

**ALWAYS try the address directly in the URL first.** Both Google Maps and Apple Maps auto-geocode addresses - no parsing needed!

### Apple Maps (Preferred - Native macOS, Fastest)
```bash
# Satellite view with address (Apple Maps auto-geocodes)
open "maps://?q=110+Clover+St+Cedar+Creek+Texas&t=h"

# Satellite view with coordinates and zoom
open "maps://?t=h&ll=30.0872,-97.5014&z=18"
```

### Google Maps (Alternative - Browser-based)
```bash
# Satellite view with address (Google Maps auto-geocodes)
open "https://www.google.com/maps/search/110+Clover+St+Cedar+Creek+Texas/@?layer=satellite"

# Satellite view with coordinates and zoom
open "https://www.google.com/maps/@30.0872,-97.5014,18z/data=!3m1!1e3"
```

### Force Satellite View with AppleScript
```bash
# Activate Maps and set to satellite view (Cmd+3)
osascript -e 'tell app "Maps" to activate' \
  -e 'delay 1' \
  -e 'tell app "System Events" to keystroke "3" using command down'
```

### Only Geocode If:
- ❌ You need exact lat/lon for calculations
- ❌ The address format is unusual or international
- ❌ You're doing multi-location analysis with coordinates

**NEVER waste tool calls geocoding when the address works directly in the URL!**

## Obtaining Coordinates

### From Address (Geocoding - No API Key)
```bash
# Nominatim/OpenStreetMap - replace spaces with +
ADDRESS="123+Main+St,+Des+Moines,+Iowa"
curl -s "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=${ADDRESS}&format=json" | jq -r '.[0] | "\(.lat),\(.lon)"'
```

### From Device Location (macOS)
```bash
# Requires Location Services enabled in System Settings > Privacy
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get the value of location'

# Alternative: Use CoreLocation via swift (more reliable)
swift -e 'import CoreLocation; let m=CLLocationManager(); if let l=m.location { print("\(l.coordinate.latitude),\(l.coordinate.longitude)") }'
```

### From IP (Approximate - Fallback)
```bash
curl -s "https://ipapi.co/json" | jq -r '"\(.latitude),\(.longitude)"'
```

### Manual Lookup
- **Google Maps**: Right-click location → "What's here?" → coordinates appear at bottom
- **Apple Maps**: Long-press to drop pin → tap pin → coordinates in info panel
- **What3Words**: Convert 3-word address at what3words.com

### From Property Address (Google Geocoding)
```bash
# If you have Google API key
curl -s "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=123+Farm+Rd,+Iowa&key=YOUR_KEY" | jq -r '.results[0].geometry.location | "\(.lat),\(.lng)"'
```

## URL Patterns (Use with bash `open` command)

### Google Maps Satellite
```
https://www.google.com/maps/@{LAT},{LON},{ZOOM}z/data=!3m1!1e3
```
- ZOOM: 1-21 (21=max detail, 18=buildings clear, 15=property, 12=region)

### Google Earth Web
```
https://earth.google.com/web/@{LAT},{LON},{ALT}a,35y,0h,0t,0r
```
- ALT: altitude in meters (500=high detail, 2000=overview)

### Bing Maps Aerial
```
https://www.bing.com/maps?cp={LAT}~{LON}&lvl={ZOOM}&style=a
```

### Sentinel Hub (Agricultural/NDVI)
```
https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/?zoom={ZOOM}&lat={LAT}&lng={LON}
```

### ESRI World Imagery
```
https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?center={LON},{LAT}&level={ZOOM}
```

## Execution Examples

### Method 1: Direct Address (FASTEST)
```bash
# Apple Maps - Single command for address + satellite + screenshot
open "maps://?q=110+Clover+St+Cedar+Creek+Texas&t=h"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/satellite_capture.png
```

### Method 2: Address with Multi-Zoom (Apple Maps)
```bash
ADDRESS="110+Clover+St+Cedar+Creek+Texas"

# Regional view (zoom 12)
open "maps://?q=${ADDRESS}&t=h&z=12"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/overview_z12.png

# Property level (zoom 16)
open "maps://?q=${ADDRESS}&t=h&z=16"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/property_z16.png

# Structure detail (zoom 19)
open "maps://?q=${ADDRESS}&t=h&z=19"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/structures_z19.png
```

### Method 3: Coordinates with Multi-Zoom (Google Maps)
```bash
LAT=37.7749; LON=-122.4194

# Regional context
open "https://www.google.com/maps/@${LAT},${LON},12z/data=!3m1!1e3"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/z12.png

# Property level
open "https://www.google.com/maps/@${LAT},${LON},16z/data=!3m1!1e3"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/z16.png

# Structure detail
open "https://www.google.com/maps/@${LAT},${LON},19z/data=!3m1!1e3"
sleep 4
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/z19.png
```

### Method 4: With AppleScript for Reliable Satellite View
```bash
# Uses AppleScript to force satellite mode and fullscreen for better quality
osascript <<'EOF'
property theAddress : "110 Clover St, Cedar Creek, Texas"

-- Open Apple Maps with satellite view
do shell script "open 'maps://?q=" & theAddress & "&t=h'"

tell application "Maps"
    activate
end tell

delay 2

-- Force satellite view (Cmd+3)
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Maps"
        keystroke "3" using command down
    end tell
end tell

delay 4

-- Fullscreen for better screenshot
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Maps"
        keystroke "f" using {command down, control down}
    end tell
end tell

delay 1

-- Capture
do shell script "screencapture -x ~/Desktop/satellite_" & (do shell script "date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S") & ".png"
EOF
```

### Screenshot commands
```bash
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/capture.png          # Silent full screen
screencapture -i ~/Desktop/selection.png        # Interactive select
screencapture -T 5 -x ~/Desktop/delayed.png     # 5 second delay
```

## Visual Verification (CRITICAL STEP)

**After opening the map, ALWAYS verify you're looking at the correct location!**

```bash
# After capture, analyze the screenshot to confirm the address
# Use image analysis to check that the location markers and labels are correct
# If location is wrong:
#   1. Check the address spelling
#   2. Try full address with ZIP code
#   3. Use explicit coordinates instead
#   4. Re-open map and re-capture
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Last session used approximate town coordinates (Cedar Creek center) instead of actual property
- Result: 4 wrong screenshots wasted before discovery
- Prevention: Analyze first screenshot to confirm correct location before multi-zoom sequence

## Complete Workflow (Agent Must Follow)

### Step 1: Detect Input Type
```
- User provides ADDRESS → Use directly in URL (Method 1 or 2)
- User provides COORDINATES → Use in URL (Method 3)
- User says "my location" → Get device location first
```

### Step 2: Open Map with Address/Coordinates
```bash
# Preferred: Apple Maps (faster, native)
open "maps://?q=ADDRESS&t=h"

# Alternative: Google Maps (browser-based)
open "https://www.google.com/maps/search/ADDRESS/@?layer=satellite"
```

### Step 3: Wait for Tiles
```bash
sleep 4  # Allow satellite imagery to load fully
```

### Step 4: Capture Screenshot
```bash
screencapture -x ~/Desktop/satellite_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).png
```

### Step 5: Visual Verification
```bash
# Analyze the screenshot:
# - Does it show the correct address?
# - Are the location labels visible?
# - Is the satellite view active (not road view)?
# If NO → Adjust and re-open map
```

### Step 6: Multi-Zoom Analysis (Optional)
```bash
# If more detail needed, repeat steps 2-5 at different zoom levels:
# - zoom 12 (regional)
# - zoom 16 (property)
# - zoom 19 (structures)
```

## Zoom Level Reference

| Zoom | View Level | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| 10-12 | County/Region | Context, neighboring properties |
| 13-15 | Township | Property boundaries, road access |
| 16-17 | Property | Field layout, major structures |
| 18-19 | Buildings | Structure identification |
| 20-21 | Detail | Roof condition, equipment |

## Provider Selection

| Need | Best Provider |
|------|---------------|
| General/Buildings | Google Maps |
| 3D/Terrain | Google Earth |
| Crop health/NDVI | Sentinel Hub |
| Alternative imagery | Bing Maps |
| Historical | Google Earth timeline |

## Farm Analysis Workflow

1. **Overview** (zoom 12): Regional context, access roads
2. **Property** (zoom 16): Boundaries, field divisions
3. **Structures** (zoom 19): Building inventory
4. **Crop Analysis**: Use Sentinel for vegetation indices

## Coordinate Format

Use Decimal Degrees (DD):
- Latitude: -90 to 90 (negative = South)
- Longitude: -180 to 180 (negative = West)
- Example: 37.7749, -122.4194

## Output Organization

Save captures to organized folders:
```
~/Desktop/farm_analysis/
├── overview/    (zoom 10-14)
├── property/    (zoom 15-17)
├── structures/  (zoom 18-21)
```

## Integration

Use bash tool to execute `open` commands. Use `sleep 3-5` between URL and screenshot to allow tiles to load. Maximize browser window for best capture quality.
