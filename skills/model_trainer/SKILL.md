# Model Trainer Skill

## Overview
This skill helps you train and fine-tune language models using TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) on Hugging Face infrastructure.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning
- Load pre-trained models from Hugging Face Hub
- Prepare datasets for fine-tuning
- Configure training arguments
- Handle model checkpointing and saving

### 2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Set up reward models
- Configure PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) training
- Manage reward datasets
- Monitor training metrics

### 3. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configuration
- QLoRA for quantized training
- Memory-efficient fine-tuning strategies

### 4. Training Infrastructure
- Hugging Face Jobs integration
- Multi-GPU training setup
- Distributed training configuration
- Resource optimization

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Fine-Tuning
1. Choose a base model from Hugging Face Hub
2. Prepare your training dataset
3. Configure training arguments
4. Set up the trainer with appropriate parameters
5. Monitor training progress and metrics

### RLHF Training
1. Set up a reward model
2. Prepare preference datasets
3. Configure PPO training parameters
4. Run training with appropriate safety constraints
5. Evaluate model performance

### PEFT Training
1. Choose PEFT method (LoRA/QLoRA)
2. Configure adapter parameters
3. Set up memory-efficient training
4. Save and load adapter weights

## Dependencies
